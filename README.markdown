## About  

All the magic for the [vienna-rb](http://www.vienna-rb.at) site happens here! Our site is powered by [Octopress](http://octopress.org) and we mostly use it for our weekly picks and, sometimes, recaps of our monthly meetups.  

## The meetup

Our meetup (usually) takes place every first Thursday of the month at the amazing [sektor5](http://www.sektor5.at). The best way to check the meetup date and schedule is on [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/vienna-rb). We love newcomers and are open to talk suggestions if you have something you want to share with our local community! Just get in touch.

## Contributing

We're always happy about contributions, especially to our weekly picks! The picks are just links to interesting articles or neat tools that we want everyone to know and get excited about; so if you've just discovered something awesome and you think we might like it too, don't hesitate to let us know about it. We publish the picks every Wednesday.  

In order to contribute your picks, follow these steps:  
- fork the repo (or clone it, whichever way you prefer)  
- create a new branch locally (something like `your-name-picks`)  
- you will find our picks in the `source/_posts` folder; find the post with the right date, and add your picks at the bottom. We usually add three per person each week, but it can be less or more, depending on all the exciting stuff you've found!  
- commit your changes  
- create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)!  

If you've never done a pull request before, don't worry! There's a first time for everything. We think [this](https://github.com/muan/hello-world) is a pretty great resource to get started. And if you get stuck or have any questions, hit us up on [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/viennarb) or open an issue in this repo.
