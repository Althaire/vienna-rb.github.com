The Quick Version
===

vienna.rb is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment in any form.

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate, including that used in talks, workshops, parties, on Twitter and other online media. People violating these rules will be sanctioned or expelled from (a) future event(s) at the discretion of the vienna.rb team.

The Less Quick Version
===
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

People asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Their staff members (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing / uniforms / costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If anyone engages in harassing behavior, our team members may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the venue.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the staff immediately.

Team members will be happy to help anyone contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe. We value your presence.

This Code of Conduct is based on the [2012 JSconf](http://2012.jsconf.us/#/about) & [The Ada Initiative Code of Conduct](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy)
