### 09/10 Picks!!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the twenty-fifth edition:

##### [Andy][1]:
  - [Boson for kids][2] - The boson explained for children (grownups can watch too). 
  - [Applicative functors - you probably haven't heard of them][3] - What every hipster should know about Functional Programming ([slides][9]).
  - [Weird Machines][4] - Lessons in Instruction-less Computation, from the WOOT '13 conference. 
  
##### [Floor][5]:
  - [iloveopensource][6] - And I'm not afraid to show it!
  - [From Nand to Tetris in 12 Steps][7] - Currently going through this, super interesting.
  - [The Legacy of Web Languages][8] - Compared to the web of old, the way we develop sites has altered drastically. Here's how.
