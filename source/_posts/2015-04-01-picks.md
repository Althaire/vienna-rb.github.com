### 04/01 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundredth (!!!) edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [Space Apps Challenge][2] - The Space Apps Challenges are online in preparation for the worldwide NASA Hackathon next week. \o/
- [Debugging Memory Leaks in Ruby][3] - Sam Saffron walks us through the current tooling to hunt down memory leaks
- [Nth-Test][4] - The ultimate nth-child visual tester

##### [Aaron][5]:
- [Hack This Site][6] - "a free, safe and legal training ground for hackers to test and expand their hacking skills." There are hacking contests and other pretty neat stuff.
- [15 Top Ruby/Rails Events Around The Globe][7] - A nice list of Ruby and Rails events/conferences around the world with descriptions.
- [My Moleskine GTD System][8] - I've been trying to do more writing lately... you know... with a pen and paper. I almost forgot how to do it. This article shows an interesting way to move your GTD system from Omni Focus or Wunderlist to a handy moleskine.


##### [Floor][9]:
- [one cfp to rule them all][10] - cfp for EuRuKo, eurucamp and jRubyConf are now open.
- [Google Maps PAC-MAN][11] - YES.
