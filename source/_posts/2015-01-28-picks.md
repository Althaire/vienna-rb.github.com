### 01/28 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the ninety-first edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [How to write the perfect pull request][2] - "Use emoji to clarify tone" and other great tips.
- [][3] -
- [][4] -

##### [Aaron][5]:
- [Just use double-quoted strings][6] - It turns out there isn't a signifcant performance loss using double quoted strings in Ruby (because of interpolation). Interesting comment threads about semantics.
- [libsass][7] - Do you think your SASS compilation times are slow? Do you need a speed boost? Make your asset builds magnitudes (yes magnitudes) faster with libsass 
- [thoughtbot/til][8] - til (today i learned) is a repo where people can add snippets for things that they learn in different technologies that they think is worth writing down for others. There are both a [Ruby](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til/tree/master/ruby) and a [Rails](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til/tree/master/rails) section. More great stuff from the folks at [thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot)
