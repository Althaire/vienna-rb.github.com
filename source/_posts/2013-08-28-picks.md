### 28/8 Picks!!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the nineteenth edition:

##### [Andy][1]:
  - [Solving the Puzzle of Scalable Log Processing][2] - How Travis CI deals with the logs of AAAAALL the builds.
  - [Puppet at GitHub][3] - Will Farrington gives an insight on how GitHub uses Puppet.
  - [Keynote PuppetConf 2013][4] - Why Did We Think Large Scale Distributed Systems Would be Easy? 
  - [go koans][8] - For those who want to learn Go test driven.

##### [Floor][5]:
  - [DevFest Vienna][6] - DevFest Vienna is a three-day event designed for curious developers. Their Sunday hackathon is OpenHack-styled and aims to get Vienna's user groups working together on projects. 
  - [GitLab 6.0 Released][7] - My friends at GitLab released their latest version, with loads of improvements. Merge requests ftw!
  - [unerdwear][8] - Unerdwear created a special 'nerdie' for Rails Girls - a late summer MUST-HAVE. All profits will be donated to Rails Girls Summer of Code.
