### 01/5 Picks!!

In a little series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, funsies... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the third edition:

##### [Andy][1]:
  - [The Most Difficult Bug][2] - How to solve the most difficult bug of them all.
  - [Building a Ruby Library][3] - 'Building a Ruby Library, the part no one talks about', great talk by Mitchell Hashimoto, at Aloha Ruby Conf.
  - [color theme][4] - An Emacs color theme based on Heroku.

##### [Tony][5]:
  - [Clean Coders][6] - Code Casts for Software Professionals. Check out the first vid in
	the clean code series for a sneak peek. Not for free, but full of value.
  - [Method Finder][7] - a smalltalk like method finder for ruby. A real smart piece of software, and useful for
	beginners and professionals. 
  - [Her][8] - an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) that maps REST resources to Ruby objects. Much more configurable and
	easier to use than ActiveResource.

##### [Floor][9]:
  - [bieber.ly][10] - The best url shortener EVER. Thank you, Elliott Kember.
  - [gizoogle][11] - Fo' all y'all biotches who wanna find shiznit!
  - [Railsberry revisited][12] - What happened at Railsberry centainly did not stay at Railsberry. I tried to write a few recaps, you'll find them on my Tumblr.
