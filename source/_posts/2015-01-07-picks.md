### 01/7 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the eighty-eighth edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
  - [SecCasts][2] - Security Screencasts
  - [How do you become an excellent programmer?][3] - [Julia Evans][4] asked around on twitter for advice on becoming an excellent programmer and gathered some of the answers in a post 

##### [Floor][17]:
  - [Couscous][18] - ... takes markdown files and converts them into professional standard HTML docs. For those who hate on documentation writing.
  - [Ruby 2015][19] - the managing editor for SitePoint on all things Ruby shares what he thinks is in store for our favorite language this year around.
