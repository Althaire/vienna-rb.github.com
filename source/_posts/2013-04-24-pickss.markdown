### 24/4 Picks!!

In a little series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, funsies... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the second edition:

##### [Andy][1]:
  - [git-code-review][2] - An extension to git to help you with doing regular code reviews of other team members' commits.
  - [Essentials of Garbage Collection][3] - This is a very nice approach on understanding how GC works and what it does.
  - [If you are busy you do it wrong][4] - A bit older, but shows you why 'elite performers' perform the way they do. It's not only the genius that matters.

##### [Tony][5]:
  - [git-wtf][6] - a script to display the state of your repository in a readable and easy-to-scan format.
  - [Benchmarking in Ruby][7] - a short overview and nice examples.
  - [Sequel][8] - The Database Toolkit for Ruby (especially if you use [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/))

##### [Floor][9]:
  - [tmux Quick Start][10] - Just what I needed: a brief introduction to what tmux can do and how it works.
  - [Glitché][11] - Ridiculous, but oh so awesome: Glitché (iPhone app) Distort your photos using computer errors and bugs
  - [Karaoke][12] - There's a KaraokeParty at the Metalab this Friday. You don't want to miss that for the world. Believe me.
