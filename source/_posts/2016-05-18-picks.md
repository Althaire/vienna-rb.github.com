### 05/18 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-fifty-ninth edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [Site Availability is for Everybody][2] - Stella Cotton's pretty enlightening talk from RailsConf about load testing, using a real-life example. 
- [Today I accept that Rails is yesterday's software][3] - Worth a read, if only to be reminded that once in a while, we should look around and elsewhere...

##### [Ram√≥n][5]:
- [iOS: Hopscotch][6] - Game programming on your iOS device!
- [Frinkiac][7] - Do-it-yourself Simpsons GIFs.

##### [Markus][9]:
- [I'm a Good Engineer but I Suck at Building Stuff][10] - Even if you have the skills, it can be difficult to get started.
- [Do things, tell people.][11] - By doing so, you will generate interesting opportunities for yourself.
- [How Typography Can Save Your Life][12] - Typography is not something that seems to be given a lot of thought, usually. But it can make a crucial difference.

##### [Max][17]:
- [Make Ruby Great Again][18] - Talk questioning how we think about tools vs. opinions and proposing a future place for Ruby.
- [AntiPatterns Basics: Rails Controllers][19] - Refreshingly pragmatic and non-fundamentalistic tips on designing Rails-controllers.
