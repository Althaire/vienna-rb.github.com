### 05/25 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-sixtieth edition:

##### [Laura][1]:

- [Help Avdi Grimm][3] - If you've ever watched the free RubyTapas episodes, and can afford to pay for a subscription — now is the time to do so.

##### [Markus][9]:
- [“Eat, sleep, code, repeat” is such bullshit][10] - Dan Kim on the toxic hype of programming all the time.
- [How Developers Stop Learning: Rise of the Expert Beginner][11] - What happens if you reach a local maxima in your learning curve, and stay there.
- [SSH for Fun and Profit][12] - Karla, a security engineer at stripe, implements a simple SSH client in Python, and shows the basic inner workings of SSH.

##### [Max][17]:
