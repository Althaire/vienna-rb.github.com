### 10/14 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-twenty-eigth edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [Octohat][2] - Hang your non-code contributions on your hat rack
- [Photon][3] - Build Electron apps using simple HTML and CSS
- [Using webfonts in 2015][4] - A pretty good write-up

##### [Floor][9]:
- [Simple Writer][10] - Pretty sure Laura shared this already at one point in time BUT this XKCD's little app highlights difficult words in your copy. Running your beginners guide through this service is... enlightening.
- [Codecademy Summer of Code][11] - Because interesting: Codecademy sat down with their Summer of Code Challenge winner, Ethan Chiu.
- [Rails Girls Summer of Code wrap-up][12] - very much enjoying the wrap-up posts on the Rails Girls Summer of Code blog.

##### [Markus][13]:
- [Ruby Performance, a Visual Guide][14] - Everyone loves fast code, and this handy post details what tools Ruby offers for each part of your apps stack.
- [Runnable Documentation: Code for Humans][16] - GitHub tries to optimize for as little documentation as possible, and packing as much into the code as they can get away with.
- [In PostgreSQL, as in life, donâ€™t wait too long to commit][15] - It's an easy thing to overlook, but keep your transactions as short as possible.

##### [Phillipp][17]:
- [maily_herald][18] - Self-hosted Mailchimp alternative. Good alternative after the EUGH decision on Safe Harbour.
- [Conversions @ Google - Luke Wroblewski (Part 1)][19] - Not super fresh, but you see a lot what he talks about in your daily life (and you won't like it, after you watched the videos)
