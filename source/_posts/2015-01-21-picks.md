### 01/21 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the ninetieth edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [contribute to the exercism docs][2] - If you are intimitated by contributing to an open-source project with actual code.. [Katrina Owen][3] is looking for awesome people to contribute to the README and documentation. Go for it!
- [.concat() Diversity Programme][4] - you can now help fund diversity tickets for the [.concat()](https://conc.at) conference happening in March

##### [Aaron][5]:
- [Rubymotion][6] - Rubymotion has changed their revenue model. There is now more affordable supportless Indie plan for $144/year. Android support has also shipped. Yeah!
- [Decorating with SimpleDelegator][7] - An oldie but the simplest explanation I have ever seen for how to use Ruby stdlib's SimpleDelegator
- [awesome-ruby][8] - There are tons of these [awesome-X](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness) repos on github with tens of thousands of combined stars. If you haven't seen one, they are lists of problem categories like `ie. Authentication` full of links to the best library repos for that language or platform. This is the Ruby one.


##### [Floor][9]:
- [Rubyslava][10] - We all love the Bratislavian Ruby chapter, but their 45th edition is REALLY worth a visit
- [Octodown][11] - Github markdown previewing straight from your shell. Hot.
