### 02/10 Picks!!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the twenty-fourth edition:

##### [Andy][1]:
  - [shellcheck][2] - automatically detects problems with sh/bash scripts and commands. 
  - [joblint][3] - tests tech job specs for issues with sexism, culture, expectations, and recruiter fails.
  - [Secret Token][4] - Ruby on Rails Default Token Database detects if a signing token is known somewhere in the Internet, or not.
  
##### [Floor][5]:
  - [sandi_meter][6] - Introducing: a gem which automates scanning your code versus Sandi Metz' rules.
  - [GoogleVis][7] - Frontwise sure knows how to visualize the Takedown Requests dataset from Google!
  - [RubyConf 2010][8] - The Road from Ruby Hacker to Entrepreneur (by GitHub's Tom Preston-Werner).
