###Codeship.io sponsors vienna.rb user group get-together

The vienna.rb organizing team can't wait for their next developer get-together, taking place Thursday, July 18 at co-working space [Sektor5][1] (Siebenbrunnengasse 44, Vienna). 

The meetup is sponsored by [Codeship][2]. Manuel Weiss, co-founder and COO on why Codeship supports vienna.rb:
{%blockquote Codeship %}
We love what vienna.rb is doing and want to start giving back to the city and people who have given us so much. 
{%endblockquote%}

The vienna.rb team is collecting topics for lightning talks from their community. The topics so far - Making your tests faster; Continuous Deployment; Building and distributing virtualized development environments - make for an interesting evening of knowledge exchanging and networking. A little time is always reserved for spontaneous lightning talks from the attendees.

Vienna.rb meetups are open to both experienced Ruby developers and people that are new to programming.
