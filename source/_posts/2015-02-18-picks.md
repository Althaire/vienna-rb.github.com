- [95% of performance is about clean representative models][6] - Really great talk about how writing "clean code" and OOP best practice can boost your performance at the compiler level. The best talk I have seen in a long time. Warning: Java inside.
- [Why the Hell Does Your API Still Use HTTP Basic Auth?][7] - Your API may be exposing your customers' password in clear text. Interesting insights into security and UX tradeoffs.
- [Finding Your Way Around a New Rails Project][8] - If you are dumped into a legacy Rails project, here are some tips to finding out WTF is going on.
