### 02/18 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the ninety-fourth edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [MailCatcher][2] - Test your emails like WHOA
- [Becoming a Jekyll God][3] - If you weren't at our last meetup, you won't get it ;)
- [Ruby Heroes][4] - Get nominatin'!

##### [Aaron][5]:
- [95% of performance is about clean representative models][6] - Really great talk about how writing "clean code" and OOP best practice can boost your performance at the compiler level. The best talk I have seen in a long time. Warning: Java inside.
- [Why the Hell Does Your API Still Use HTTP Basic Auth?][7] - Your API may be exposing your customers' password in clear text. Interesting insights into security and UX tradeoffs.
- [Finding Your Way Around a New Rails Project][8] - If you are dumped into a legacy Rails project, here are some tips to finding out WTF is going on.


##### [Floor][9]:
- [Wi-Fi password][10] - Cool little Bash script to quickly fetch your Wi-Fi password from OS X’s keychain.
- [Rikki][11] - Katrina Owen has recently added a nitpicking robot to Exercism — an app that lets you practice your coding and get crowd-sourced mentorship - called Rikki.
- [JSConf Budapest][12] - a JSConf family member 2-day non-profit for-the-community by-the-community conference about JavaScript JUST AROUND THE CORNER! Now if you could all use my couponcode LEKKERKAASJSCONFBP you get a €50 discount and I get to send someone to Budapest who could otherwise not afford it <3
