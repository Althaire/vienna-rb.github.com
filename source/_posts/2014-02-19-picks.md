### 19/02 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the forty-third edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
  - [Boxen][2] - Automate the pain out of your development environment
  - [Acts As Enid][3] - Following my own link from last week, I put together a useless gem that spits out quotes from Ghost World. Enidify!
