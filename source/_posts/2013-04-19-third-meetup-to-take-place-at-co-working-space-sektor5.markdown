### Ruby on Rails user group meetup taking place at Sektor5

After a full house for both the first and the second vienna.rb meetups the organizing team can't wait for their next developer get-together, taking place Thursday, May the 9th at co-working space [Sektor5][1] (Siebenbrunnengasse 44, Vienna). 
Vienna.rb meetups are open to both experienced Ruby developers and people that are new to programming.

The meetup is sponsored by [Runtastic][2]:
{%blockquote Runtastic %}
At Runtastic we're using Ruby and Rails since our foundation in 2010. We like to keep our developers happy, and thus bet on Ruby whenever we can. With many members of the Ruby community being present at the vienna.rb meetup, we might meet one of our future colleagues there. 
{%endblockquote%}

The vienna.rb team collected topics for talks from their community. Starting with David Ã–sterreicher from Runtastic, Sarah Howorka will then talk about the [Rails Girls project][5]. Clemens Helm will eleborate on 'The Ruby workflow' and Andreas Kopecky will give us an insight on why he uses Sequel and its advantages to Active Record. A little time is always reserved for spontaneous lightning talks from the attendees.
