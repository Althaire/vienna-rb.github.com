### Ruby developers and Rails aficionados once more meet in Austriaâ€™s capital

After a full house for both the first and the second vienna.rb meetups the organizing team can't wait for their next developer get-together, taking place Thursday, June the 9th at co-working space [Sektor5][1] (Siebenbrunnengasse 44, Vienna). 
Vienna.rb meetups are open to both experienced Ruby developers and people that are new to programming.

{%blockquote Yves Schultz, Founder of Sektor 5 %}
RoR is used by many to bring their ideas online, to turn their visions into products and businesses. That's awesome and we're glad to be hosting vienna.rb here at sektor5, supporting the cause to bring likeminded Rubyists together!

The meetup is sponsored by [Runtastic][2]. X, X on why Runtastic supports vienna.rb:

The vienna.rb team is collecting topics for lightning talks from their community. The topics so far - Git crash course; Railsberry revisited - make for an interesting evening of knowledge exchanging and networking. The sponsors and host are
encouraged to take part in the event or even take on a lightning talk themselves.

The next edition is planned for Thursday, June 6. For more information regarding the program, please visit [viennarb on meetup][3] or follow [@viennarb][4]
