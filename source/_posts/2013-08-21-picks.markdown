### 21/8 Picks!!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the eightteenth edition:

##### [Andy][1]:
  - [rubygems-proxy][2] - The first version of a rubygems-proxy that caches the Gems for your local network.
  - [gemspec_deps_gen][3] - Builds your project dependencies inside gemspec file.
  - [rom/devtools][4] - The perfect CI rake task.

##### [Floor][9]:
  - [Kids'n'Tech][10] - Kids'n'Tech teaches HTML code to... kids, obviously.
  - [Git tips][11] - ... because there's no such thing as knowing to many shortcuts.
  - [Scala tutorials][12] - Looking forward to the launch of scalatutorials.com, MOAR learning!
