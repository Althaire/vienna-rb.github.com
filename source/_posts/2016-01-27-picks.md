### 01/27 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-forty-third edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [TrumpScript][2] - It's not Ruby but it's still too great not to share.
- [Lotus is now Hanami][3] - Lotus has recently been renamed; read all about it in this blog post.
- [][4] - 

##### [Ram√≥n][5]:
- [Nativefier][6] - Run web apps as if they were native! Runs on Electron.
- [RubyMotion: MotionKit][7] - Really helpful DSL for setting up view layouts. No need for Interface Builder files!
- [Influencing Web Layouts with Print Layouts][8] - I found this an interesting read on using more magazine-styled layouts.
