### 01/27 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-forty-third edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [TrumpScript][2] - It's not Ruby but it's still too great not to share.
- [Lotus is now Hanami][3] - Lotus has recently been renamed; read all about it in this blog post.

##### [Ramón][5]:
- [Nativefier][6] - Run web apps as if they were native! Runs on Electron.
- [RubyMotion: MotionKit][7] - Really helpful DSL for setting up view layouts. No need for Interface Builder files!
- [Influencing Web Layouts with Print Layouts][8] - I found this an interesting read on using more magazine-styled layouts.

##### [Markus][9]:
- [On Ergonomics][10] - Why an ergonomic working place is important (unless you like constant pain)
- [Conceptual Debt is Worse than Technical Debt][11] - Yes, there's something even worse than technical debt out there.
- [How to trick a neural network into thinking a panda is a vulture][12] - Neural networks can do amazing things, but they can be tricked into seeing things that aren't quite what they seem.

##### [Max][17]:
- [The Bike Shed 48: "Is Everyone Trying Their Best?"][18] - Software is broken - Derek and Sean on why it's not fun to be one of the developers who just don't care.
- [Switching from rbenv to postmodern’s ruby-install and chruby][19] - Remind the unix philosophy and ditch rbenv (or rvm) for something more lightweight.
