### 04/27 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-fifty-sixth edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [An app to diversify tech conferences][2] - How to offer diversity tickets at your conference
- [Full Stack Fest CFP][3] - submit your talk before May 14th!

##### [Markus][9]:
- [Our software must get better][10] - Sometimes, "good enough" really is enough. But often, we should keep on making it better.
- [Write code that is easy to delete, not easy to extend][11]
- [The Snowballing of Practice][12] - A little bit each day will eventually amount to a lot (see also: [compound interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest))
