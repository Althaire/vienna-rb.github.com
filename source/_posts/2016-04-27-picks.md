##### [Markus][9]:
- [Our software must get better][10] - Sometimes, "good enough" really is enough. But often, we should keep on making it better.
- [Write code that is easy to delete, not easy to extend][11]
- [The Snowballing of Practice][12] - A little bit each day will eventually amount to a lot (see also: [compound interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest))
