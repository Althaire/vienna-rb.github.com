### 10/07 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-twenty-seventh edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [GitHub as a workflow][2] - An interesting look at agile pull requests.
- [How to learn a new programming language][3] - .. while maintaining your day job and still being there for your family
- [The End and a Beginning][4] - Rails Girls Summer of Code 2015 is over. A look at all the awesome people who made it happen.

##### [Aaron][5]:
- [Faraday Gem][6] - Faraday is an HTTP libarary wrapper and middleware suite that makes it easy to build clients to external services. I have been using it a lot lately and I am really liking it.
- [Virtus Gem][7] - Virtus gives you a way to create application domain objects that support some cool stuff like type coersion. It is a great partner with Faraday if your work requires a lot of interfacing with outside services.

##### [Floor][9]:
- [Brian Griffin in pure CSS][10] - Because amazing.
- [arrrrcamp hug][11] - Because nostalgic.
- [ROSSConf recap][12] - Because I had a minute.

##### [Markus][13]:
- [What every programmer absolutely, positively needs to know about encodings and character sets to work with text][14] - Every developer has to deal with text. Knowing what encodings are exactly and how they work will save you a lot of pain and headaches.
- [9 tips for better database design][15] - Thinking about your data model beforehand will save you time, stress, and tears later down the line, and these tips will help you make better decisions.
- [Storing Data with Redis][16] - You wouldn't stuff all your data into one single table. Why are you doing it when you're using Redis, then, asks Mike Perham.
