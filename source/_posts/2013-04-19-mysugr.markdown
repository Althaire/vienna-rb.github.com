## MySugr switched from Ruby to Java. Here's why:

We build the mySugr iPhone App to help ourselves and other people master the diabetes monster. Founded by @geraldstangl, @fdebong and a guy who won't tweet
Diabetes sucks and can sometimes get you down. Show this troublemaker who’s the boss and feed the mySugr Diabetes App with your data. If you keep logging regularly, you will make great use of your data and get rewarded with valuable feedback in your day-to-day life.

Diabetes has become an epidemic and is counted as one
of the most common reasons of death in modern society.

Gerald Stangl, Fredrik Debong, Frank Westermann, Michael Forisch in 2011 and launched in April 2012, mySugr have 10.000 users mainly in Austria, Germany and Italy.
