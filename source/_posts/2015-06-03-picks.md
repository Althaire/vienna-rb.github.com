### 06/03 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-ninth edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [hirb][2] - view framework for console/irb
- [solved by flexbox][3] - vertically aligning with css.. a dream come true.
- [lolcat][4] - an oldie but goldie: rainbows and unicorns!

##### [Aaron][5]:
- [Unpacking Ampersand + To_proc][6] - Article about writing tighter Ruby code. Helpful if you aren't using the `(&:message)` syntax or have never heard of it.
- [Rubyconf Portugal 14-15 September][7] - I went last year (their first year) and it was fantastic. The lineup looks great and Braga and the venue are very nice. Maybe I'll see you there!


##### [Floor][9]:
- [Github Engineering Blog][10] - Github recently released their all-new Engineering blog.
- [Tropical Ruby][11] - Tropical Ruby released talk recordings from their March' conference. Worth checking out!
