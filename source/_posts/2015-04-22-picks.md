### 04/22 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-third edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [Estimating time for web projects more accurately][2] - in spite of it being really old, this article is a pretty good overview of how to somewhat accurately estimate web projects.
- [12 resolutions for programmers][3] - Challenge yourself with a new, month-sized, resolution every month.
- [Existing HTML rel values][4] - Entertaining to see how many strange rel values exist in HTML (hashtag: crush)


##### [Floor][9]:
- [Sublime 3.0][10] -  This is a pick for Laura; setting up Sublime Text 3 for Ruby Development.
- [Arrrrcamp CFP is open][11] - Because speaking at ArrrrCamp is arrrrsome!
- [awesome events][12] - Gerald collects awesome (Ruby related) events in his awesome events repo.
