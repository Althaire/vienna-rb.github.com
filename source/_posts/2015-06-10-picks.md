##### [Dave][13]:

[Apache Lucene][14] is an amazing Java library for doing indexing and
searching of your data. It's the core of [Apache Solr][15] and v5.2.0 was
just released.

- [Apache Solr][15] - scalable blazing fast search platform
- [ElasticSearch][16] - a well-known commercial product based on the core Lucene
technology
- [LogStash][17] - JRuby based analytics tool
- [Kibana][18] - a superb browser based analytics and search dashboard
- [RSolr][19] - a low-level gem for talking to Solr
- [Sunspot][19] - a nifty gem & DSL for talking to Solr directly

All of these are using [Inverted Indexes][21] - a really nice explanation.
