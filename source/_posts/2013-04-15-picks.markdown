### Picks / what the vienna.rb team thinks is worth sharing this week

In a little series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, funsies... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's to the first edition:

##### Andy:
[CodeTriage][1]; Help your favorite open source projects. They have bugs, they need help!
[Why does it call the "wrong" equal method? - on Stack Overflow][2]; The title is pretty much selfexplainatory.

##### Tony:
[RadarServices][3] - 
[RadarServices][4] - 

##### Floor:
[Bootstrap HTML Button generator][5]; Bootstrapping buttons. Because why would you want to reinvent the wheel?
[List of Hello World Programs in 300 Programming Languages][6]; A complete list of “Hello World!” programs written in more than 300 existing programming languages including Assembly language, Low-level, High-level, Object Oriented, Document formats, Page description languages and Scripting languages. How awesome is that?
