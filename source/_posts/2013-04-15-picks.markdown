### Picks / what the vienna.rb team thinks is worth sharing this week

In a little series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, funsies... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's to the first edition:

##### Andy:
  - [CodeTriage][1] - Help your favorite open source projects. They have bugs, they need help!
  - [Why does it call the "wrong" equal method? - on Stack Overflow][2] - The title is pretty much selfexplainatory.
  - [Return to the Essence of Text Editing][8] - Emacs is a pretty neat everything, but also a decent text editor.

##### Tony:
  - [Objects On Rails][3] - a "developer's notebook" documenting some guidelines, techniques, and ideas for applying classic object-oriented thought to Ruby on Rails applications.
  - [Clean Coders][4] - educational videos for software professionals, by software professionals.
  - [vim-rails][9] - vim is the **best** rails editor of all times.

##### Floor:
  - [Bootstrap HTML Button generator][5] - Bootstrapping buttons. Because why would you want to reinvent the wheel?
  - [List of Hello World Programs in 300 Programming Languages][6] - A complete list of “Hello World!” programs written in more than 300 existing programming languages including Assembly language, Low-level, High-level, Object Oriented, Document formats, Page description languages and Scripting languages. How awesome is that?
  - [starlogs.net][7] - Putting Geek in GitHub. Once more.
