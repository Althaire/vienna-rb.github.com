### 18/6 Picks!!

In a little series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, funsies... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the ninth edition:

##### [Andy][1]:
  - [A Short Story on Human Error][2] - There is no single root cause or the further back you go in time, the more reasons you'll find that there's a tangled web of lots of little causes, that again have their own causes.
  - [Your top 100 unix commands, for science!][3] - Contribute your daily used Unix commands.
  - [Rapid Web Development in the Browser using Espresso][4] - Interesting and fast way to push out a prototype.

##### [Tony][5]:
  - [][6] -
  - [][7] -
  - [][8] -

##### [Floor][9]:
  - [svn-git][10] - crash course to svn for (former) git users, written by yours truly.
  - [version eye][11] - Follow your libraries and get notified about new versions. Visually neat tool.
  - [gist-dep][12] - Anytime you want to re-use code but the amount of code is so small it would be silly to create a library.
