### 18/6 Picks!!

In a little series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, funsies... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the ninth edition:

##### [Andy][1]:
  - [][2] - 
  - [][3] - 
  - [][4] - 

##### [Tony][5]:
  - [][6] - 
  - [][7] - 
  - [][8] - 

##### [Floor][9]:
  - [svn-git][10] - crash course to svn for (former) git users, written by yours truly.
  - [version eye][11] - Follow your libraries and get notified about new versions. Visually neat tool.
  - [gist-dep][12] - Anytime you want to re-use code but the amount of code is so small it would be silly to create a library.
