### 05/27 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-eighth edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [Emoji Minesweeper][2] - Because this is the internet and you get [what you ask for][3]. 
- [Daily things you can do to help you with writing code][4] - Some pretty neat advice by [Zach Holman](https://twitter.com/holman).

##### [Aaron][5]:
- [Spina CMS][6] - The new Rails powered CMS on the block.
- [Oga][7] - A (mostly) Ruby Nokogiri replacement. It aims to be cross Ruby implementation and thread safe. Looks interesting.

##### [Floor][9]:
- [Ruby Heroes][10] - Listen to my favorite podcast people from The Changelog talking with 2015â€™s Ruby Heroes.
- [Ariel Waldman is so awesome][11] - Github talked to space kid Ariel Waldman about her experiences at NASA and her upcoming CodeConf talk.
- [Atom swag][12] - There's an [Atom shirt][12] in the Octoshop, to celebrate [Atom's 1 year anniversary][13]. Also, Github will release a Pridetocat shirt to celebrate [Pride Week][14].
