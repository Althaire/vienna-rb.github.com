### 29/01 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the fortieth edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
  - [Austria Game Jam 2014][2] - The links to this year's games are online. Play away!
  - [Web applications with Ruby (not Rails)][3] - David Padilla's talk from ArrrrCamp.
  - [Have I been pwned?][4] - ...because data breaches.

##### [Alex][5]:
  - [467 tests, 0 failures, 0 confidence][6] - Katrina Owen about the purpose of tests.
  - [Trailer][7] - A faster and easier way to deal with pull requests
  - [Dot Navigation Styles][8] - Subtle effects for simple dot navigation

##### [Ben][9]:
  - [Tales of an Ops Team: Confessions of a Chatbot][10]
  - [Prototype based programming][11] - Featuring: Self, NewtonScript, Io, and, yes, JavaScript. Plus: the dunder is back

##### [Tony][13]:
  - [$://showterm][14] - Record Terminal Sessions! And it's in Ruby, too!
  - [Of Orcs and Software Craftsmanship][15] - XML parsing, a developer's view. Don't let the foreign language (=Java) discourage you!
  - [International Table Top Day][16] - Play More Games! (I admit, I am a fan)
