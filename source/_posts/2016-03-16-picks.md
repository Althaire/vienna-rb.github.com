### 03/16 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-forty-third edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [][2] - 
- [][3] - 
- [][4] - 

##### [Ram√≥n][5]:
- [][6] - 
- [][7] - 
- [][8] - 

##### [Markus][9]:
- [Stopping killer asteroids costs less than you think][10] - There's actually a lesson in here for software projects as well: The earlier you catch potential problems, the easier and cheaper they can be to solve. But you need to know what to look for in the first place.
- [A succesful Git branching model considered harmful][11]
- [A practical introduction to functional programming][12] - Never really understood all the hubbub about functional programming? This is a practical introduction, using practical imperative examples, and turning them into functional code.
