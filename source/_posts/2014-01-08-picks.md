### 08/01 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the thirty-seventh edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
  - [Projects][2] - A list of practical projects to be solved in any language.
  - [The Mathematical Reality of Reality][3] - An interview with cosmologist Max Tegmark.
  - [Cruncher][4] - An implementation of Bret Victor's Scrubbing Calculator.

##### [Alex][5]:
  - [Spacegray][6] - A set of minimal Sublime Text 2/3 themes.
  - [Sublime Ruby Debugger][7] - Debugger plugin for interactive ruby and RoR debugging on Sublime Text.
  - [CDN for Rails][8] - Setting up a cloudfront CDN for Rails.

##### [Ben][9]:
  - [Connection Pooling][10] - Setting ActiveRecord's connection pool size on Heroku with Puma or Sidekiq
  - [FFmpeg Security][11] - FFmpeg and a thousand fixes

##### [Tony][13]
  - [Martin Fowler: Branch by Abstraction][14] - Make a large-scale change while releasing regularily.
  - [Mocks are "breaking encapsulation"][15] - Grzegorz Gałęzowski disagrees with his notions (and I agree with him).
  - [Extreme Programming, a Reflection][16] - Uncle Bob Martin gives a lot of nostalgia a reality check. We've come far!
