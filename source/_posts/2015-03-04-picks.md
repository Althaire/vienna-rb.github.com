- [The Volt Framework][6] - Volt is a newer Ruby web framework which has a goal of sharing Ruby on the frontend and backend. I am pretty excited about it
- [Isomorphic App Development with Ruby and Volt by Ryan Stout][7] - A great talk about Volt by its creator.
- [Why Timehop Chose Go to Replace Our Rails App][8] - I have been writing some Go code lately and this is an interesting article about one team's choice to switch when trying to scale their rails app.


##### [Floor][9]:
- [HTML5 number inputs][10] - Because I hate it when an app doesn't recognize both a comma AND a period as decimal marks
