### 12/16 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-thirty-seventh edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [Italy on Rails][2] - A code-journey through Italy; you can apply by email to participate for two weeks in April/May.
- [Advent of Code][3] - Small and self-contained programming puzzled to count your way to Christmas!
- [Coursera][4] - Coursera now has a Ruby On Rails Specialization from Johns Hopkins University.

##### [Aaron][5]:
- [][6] - 
- [][7] - 
- [][8] -

##### [Markus][9]:
- [The Adventures of printf: A Short Story][10] - Fred Herbet takes us on a journey of a little guy named printf, who's in search of mentoring as a programmer &mdash; and the greater meaning of why we code.
- [When to not be a software craftsman][11] - Programming is often talked about as either art or a craft. But Chad Fowler argues that sometimes, it's neither &mdash; and that's ok.
- [I Dreamed of a Perfect Database][12] - Paul Ford thinks about databases, and how we order information can reshape our world.
