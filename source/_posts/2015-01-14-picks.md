### 01/14 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the eighty-ninth edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
  - [Git Magic][2] - A book to achieve Git Grandmastery (maybe)
  - [PGCLI][3] - Postgres command line interface with autocompletion and syntax highlighting
  - [Origami Robots][4] - Harvard & MIT create the first self-assembling robots

##### [Aaron][5]:
  - [Healthy Migration Habits][6] - If you have felt the pain of referencing your ActiveRecord models in data migrations, here are some great tips
  - [Postgres Full-Text Search is Good Enough!][7] - PostgreSQL does lots of things really well. Here is a short but sweet intro to full-text search using your favorite database.
  - [Writing Fast Ruby (slides)][8] - I normally wouldn't share slides but these are incredibly useful and beautifully designed. A little premature optimization for you :)

##### [Floor][9]:
  - [ginatra][10] - ... is a simple web-based git repository browser built on Ruby Sinatra
  - [Hate glitter mail][11] - ship your enemies glitter (via [Sebastian][12])
  - [Study group][17] - The Berlin based study group Ruby Monsters wrote up some tips on coaching a programming study group
