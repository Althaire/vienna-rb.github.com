### Ruby developers and Rails aficionados once more meet in Austriaâ€™s capital

After a full house for the first vienna.rb meetup in March the organizing team moves to co-working space [Sektor5][1] (Siebenbrunnengasse 44, Vienna) for their next developer get-together. Friday, April the 12th they will combine TGIF and meeting like minded people. Vienna.rb meetups are open to both experienced Ruby developers and people that are new to programming.

{%blockquote Yves Schultz, Founder of Sektor 5 %}
RoR is used by many to bring their ideas online, to turn their visions into products and businesses. That's awesome and we're glad to be hosting vienna.rb here at sektor5, supporting the cause to bring likeminded Rubyists together!
{%endblockquote%}

The meetup is sponsored by [RadarServices][2]. Christian Polster, Head of Strategy & Finance on why RadarServices supports
vienna.rb:
{%blockquote Christian Polster, RadarServices Smart IT Security %}
We believe that vienna.rb is the ideal opportunity for all current and future Rubyists to exchange knowledge and best
practises. Thereby the enthusiasm for RoR is spread in the community and it helps companies like us to be able to
implement the ideas for products and services in an ideal way.
{%endblockquote%}

The vienna.rb team is collecting topics for lightning talks from their community. The topics so far - Speeding up tests,
Rails 4 preview - make for an interesting evening of knowledge exchanging and networking. The sponsors and host are
encouraged to take part in the event or even take on a lightning talk themselves.

The next edition is planned for the 9th of May. For more information regarding the program, please visit [viennarb on meetup][3] or follow [@viennarb][4]
