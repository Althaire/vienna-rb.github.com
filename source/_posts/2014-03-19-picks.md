### 19/03 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the forty-seventh edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
  - [So you think you know Vim?][2] - Is it a quiz? Is it a game?
  - [Gutter Color][3] - A Sublime Text 3 Package
  - [Gittip][4] - Sustainable Crowdfunding for your favorite people

##### [Alex][5]:
  - [Feature Flipper for Rails][6] - Flip lets you declare and manage feature flags
  - [Testing at Airbnb][7] - "[...]The bar to writing tests should be, 'so low you can trip over it.'[...]"
  - [Github Pull Request Triage tool][8] - Its goal is to try to get an overview of what needs to happen next to open pull requests.
