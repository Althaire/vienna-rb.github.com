### 05/04 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-fifty-seventh edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [RailsConf keynote livestream][2] - every RailsConf keynote will be streamed live this year â€” you can find the schedule [here][4].
- [Coding Mit Herz][3] - I was recently briefly interviewed by Smart Ninja about programming. Check it out! #shameless-plug 

##### [Markus][9]:
- [Linguistics, Style and Writing in the 21st Century (Video)][10] - Just because it's obvious to you, it's not obvious to everyone else. Steven Pinker on the curse of knowledge.
- [You play like you practice][11] - If you cut corners when you practice something, you'll get it wrong later when it matters.
- [Doing the right thing the wrong way][12] - Good design is not just about empathy, it's also about inclusion and diversity.

##### [Max][17]:
- [Being A Developer After 40][18] - Interesting package of insights, history and lessons learned from a 42 years-old developer.
- [Blocks, Procs, and Enumerable][19] - Refreshing the knowledge on Ruby's `Enumberable` module and its actual awesomeness.
- [Factories Should be the Bare Minimum][20] - Avoid surprises in the wrong moment by keeping your factories minimal.
