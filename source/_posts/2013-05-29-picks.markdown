### 29/5 Picks!!

In a little series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, funsies... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the sixth edition:

##### [Andy][1]:

  - [][3] - 
  - [][4] - 

##### [Tony][5]:
  - [][6] -

##### [Floor][9]:
  - [content management with GitHub][10] - I wrote a little something to help group bloggers 'version control' their content with GitHub...
  - [prose.io][11] - ... to make things less technical for those new to Git, @bastilian suggested using prose.io; 
  - [draftin.com][12] - and @hannesfostie suggested draftin.com, version control for writing.
