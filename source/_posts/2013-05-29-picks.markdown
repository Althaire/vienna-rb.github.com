### 29/5 Picks!!

In a little series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, funsies... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the sixth edition:

##### [Andy][1]:
  - [Introduction to Randomness and Random Numbers][2] - A good read on why it is so hard to get a computer generate good random data.
  - [Storm SSH][3] - A nifty tool that helps you organizing your SSH config.
  - [Rails Girls summer of code ][4] - Support them as much as YOU can. It's a great and important project.

##### [Tony][5]:
  - [logstash][6] - a tool for managing events and logs. In JRuby!
  - [The Principles of OOD][7] - Object Oriented Design. Uncle Bob Martin. 'nuff said.


##### [Floor][9]:
  - [content management with version control 1][10] - I wrote a little something to help group bloggers 'version control' their content with GitHub...
  - [content management with version control 2][11] - ... and then I wrote a follow-up post, processing the feedback I got on Twitter and the likes.
  - [mephisto][12] - Remember Mephisto, that blog engine based on Rails? It has been forked & revived by Sebastian Gräßl, so take a look!
