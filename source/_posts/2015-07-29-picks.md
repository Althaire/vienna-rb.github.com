### 07/29 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-seventeenth edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [Get Off Your Horse and Stop Coding Like a Cowboy][2] - A long read (but worth it) about how teams work together
- [How DNS Works][3] - Basically the best web comic there is about DNS and how it works.
- [eurucamp][4] - it's that time of the year again: eurucamp! pro tip: Our very own Floor Drees is MC'ing!

##### [Aaron][5]:
- [Ruby Delegate.rb Secrets][6] - A great description of how `SimpleDelegator` works in the Ruby Standard Library. I've read a few of these and this is the best so far.
- [An Introduction to Securing your Linux VPS][7] - Digital Ocean puts out a ton of great content. Here are some tips on securing your server. Take the info and put it directly into your deploy scripts... Please...


##### [Floor][9]:
- [RubyIssues][10] - A curated list of ruby related issues collected from GitHub. Bi-monthly email delivery with the ambition to provide an entry point to the Open Source space for developers of all levels.
- [DERP][11] - 'How to Handle Error Messages Like a Boss', good piece on the Treehouse blog.
- [PR Log][12] - Turn Pull Requests into Changelog Entries
