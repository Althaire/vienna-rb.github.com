### 09/02 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-twenty-second edition:

##### [Aaron][5]:
- [Interface with Go code from Ruby][6] - quartz is a gem that lets you talk with native Go code from Ruby. It's like FFI for Go.
- [Ruby Rogues talk about Rails 5][7] - We will be discussing Rails 5 next meetup and here's a great intro.
- [Ruby Rouges][8] - When you accidentally type rubyrouges.com, here's what you get.


##### [Floor][9]:
- [Learn the command line][10] - Codecademy has a new CL course, highly recommended for anyone starting out. Share the news!
- [Fit Commit][11] - A Git hook to validate your commit messages, based largely on Tim Pope's authoritative guide.
- [Lean executives][12] - For years, the Small Business Administration (SBA), along with the rest of the federal government, have used the waterfall product development methodology. Until now / LEGO. Fun read.
