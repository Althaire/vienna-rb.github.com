### 09/16 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-twenty-fourth edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [Home Conf][2] - I don't know what it is but it's created by tenderlove â€“ so it must be good
- [7 lines of code, 3 minutes][3] - Implement a programming language from scratch

##### [Aaron][5]:
- [][6] -
- [][7] -
- [][8] -


##### [Floor][9]:
- [Europe Code Week][10] - October 10 - 18th it's Europe Code Week again. sektor5 provides free space and coffees for all Code Week events, so ping me if you'd like to organize something!
- [ROSSConf interviews][11] - We have put some time into interviewing the ROSSConf Berlin maintainer-speakers. Find out what Zachary's life hack entails.
