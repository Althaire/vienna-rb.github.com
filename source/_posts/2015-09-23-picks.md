### 09/23 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.

##### [Floor][9]:
- [Europe Code Week][10] - We are looking for coaches (and attendees) for our Europe Code Week - Ruby on Rails for Absolute Beginners Mini Workshop. Do Join!
- [OSCON Amsterdam 2015][11] - I'll be talking about rejoining the Tech workforce after a baby-break. But there will be other (better) talks as well. 
- [behind Airbnb][12] - Airbnb shares the keys to its infrastructure. And it's interesting.
