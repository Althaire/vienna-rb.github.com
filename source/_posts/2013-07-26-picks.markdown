### 26/7 Picks!!

In a little series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, funsies... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the fourteenth edition:

##### [Andy][1]:
  - [Top 10 Proactive Web Application Security Measures][2] - Security should concern everyone, from the developer to the CEO
  - [pkgr][3] - Package your Rails app into deb or rpm packages
  - [fpm][4] - Effing package managers! Build packages for multiple platforms (deb, rpm, etc) with great ease and sanity.

##### [Floor][9]:
  - [gem install exercism][10] - Exercism - a Katrina Owen production - is all about giving and receiving feedback. And code reviews.
  - [Laber's lab][11] - to all the makers out there, check out the dates for the [Arduino lab's][13]!
  - [Sektor5][12] - neat post (with dito pictures) about the co-working space that hosts our monthly meetups
