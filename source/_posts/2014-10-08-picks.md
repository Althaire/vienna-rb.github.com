### 10/08 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the seventy-fifth edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
  - [Student Developer Pack][2] - If you're a student, consider signing up for this awesome pack!

##### [Floor][17]:
  - [fresh guides][18] - Yay for new Rails Girls guides - 12 and 13 - by the hand of [@chastell][19].
  - [Papis blogs!][20] - Michal Papis just started a blog for RVM. Which is great.
  - [Rails Rumble][21] - Registration for this year's Rails Rumble has opened. Keep in mind that you'd have [a place to work/hack from][22], might your team need it.
