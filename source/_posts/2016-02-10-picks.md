### 02/10 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-forty-third edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [][2] - 
- [][3] - 
- [][4] - 

##### [Ramón][5]:
- [Ruby’s “unless X” is processed differently than “if !X”!][6] - Syed Humza Shah goes into some interesting intricacies of how Ruby handles boolean logic.
- [Jekyll Polyglot][7] - I was making a multi-language Jekyll page, and found this very helpful for i18n!
- [][8] - 

##### [Markus][9]:
- [NASA’s 10 rules for developing safety-critical code][10] - The software that runs anything that goes into space is very critical, regardless of humans being aboard or not. These rules help NASA write software that's unlikely to fail even if your robot is currently exploring the outer fringes of our solar system.
- [When back doors go bad: Mind your Ps and Qs][11] - Jeffrey Goldberg of 1Password explains how elliptic curve cryptography works, and why crypto that allows for backdoors (even if there aren't any) is generally less secure that crypto that doesn't allow backdoors in the first place.
- [The “Cobra Effect” that is disabling paste on password fields][12] - Troy Hunt tells the story of how the British tried to get a handle on their cobra problem in India, how it spectacularly backfired, and how this relates to modern-day snake-oil security measures.
