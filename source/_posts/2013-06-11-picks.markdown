### 11/6 Picks!!

In a little series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, funsies... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the eighth edition:

##### [Tony][5]:
  - [PostgreSQL 9.3: What's new][6] - Beta information about the Best RDBMS Ever&trade;
  - [Best Google+ Profile Ever][7] - Support the [T.S.A.][4]!
  - [For More Pair Programming][8] - Get support for your project.

##### [Floor][9]:
  - [git log][10] - Bored and tired of the old git log screen? Try this.
  - [geo-bootstrap][11] - My new favorite CSS bootstrapper: it has comic sans, funky colors and MC Hammer.
  - [Office Pi][12] - GoCardless cooked up a fancy Office Dashboard Pi.
