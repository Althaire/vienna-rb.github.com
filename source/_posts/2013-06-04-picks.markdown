  - [E.V.E.][10] - E.V.E. is a Star Trek / Jarvis type computer written in Python. Run the program, and E.V.E. will activate whenever you say "okay computer," after which you can ask it a question / command. 
  - [GitLab Summer of Code][11] - GitLab (the open source alternative to GitHub) is a Google Summer of Code project.
  - [PyLadies Vienna][12] - As one of the co-organizers of PyLadies Vienna I can't help but promote our beginners course to Python. Spread the word!
