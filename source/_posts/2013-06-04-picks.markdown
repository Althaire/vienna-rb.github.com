### 4/6 Picks!!

In a little series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, funsies... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the seventh edition:

##### [Andy][1]:
  - [How Go uses Go to build itself][2] - I am always fascinated when a programming language can compile or interpret itself.
  - [Afraid of the big nasty gem?][3] - Ever thought about evil code in a RubyGem you use? Or how can I trust software of 3rd parties?
  - [http://ascii.io/][4] - ascii.io is a neat tool to make command-line based screencasts, where you even can copy and paste the text.

##### [Floor][9]:
  - [E.V.E.][10] - E.V.E. is a Star Trek / Jarvis type computer written in Python. Run the program, and E.V.E. will activate whenever you say "okay computer," after which you can ask it a question / command.
  - [GitLab Summer of Code][11] - GitLab (the open source alternative to GitHub) is a Google Summer of Code project.
  - [PyLadies Vienna][12] - As one of the co-organizers of PyLadies Vienna I can't help but promote our beginners course to Python. Spread the word!
  - [Raspberry Pi][13] - Learn what other people use their Raspberry Pi for!
