### 12/10 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the eighty-fourth edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
  - [24 Pull Requests][2] - Giving back little gifts of code for Christmas
  - [Uncss][3] - Remove all those unused styles from your css!
  - [Regex Crosswords][4] - Show off those Regex skills you got


##### [Floor][17]:
  - [Rails Girls Brno][18] - they shot this video during their November edition and it's <3
  - [BentoBox app][19] - Nur Sah Ketene made this super useful resource for future Rails Girls workshops (or generally beginner workshops)
  - [Foodhack Vienna][20] - Aaron Cruz already introduced it during our last meetup: you can now help Austria eliminate food waste
