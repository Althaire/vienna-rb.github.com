- [Why Rails 5 / Turbolinks 3.0 / Action Cable matter, and why @dhh was right all along][7] - Controversial article about Rails 5's new set of features. Also a good intro to Rails 5's new features.

##### [Floor][9]:
- [RubyThursday][10] - Build a portfolio in a fun and engaging way. What if you had access to a set of fresh Ruby on Rails projects and tutorials that helped you consistently code on a regular basis?
