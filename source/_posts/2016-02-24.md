### 02/24 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-forty-third edition:

##### [Ram√≥n][5]:

##### [Markus][9]:
- [Understand TDD by asking one simple question][10] - Pat Maddox manages to boil down the basics of TDD into a simple question.
- [Simple 8-bit Assembler Simulator][11] - A complete simulation of a simple 8-bit assembler written in JavaScript, including visualizations of the CPU and memory. Great for exploring how a program actually works on a near-machine level.
- [Towards an understanding of technical debt][12] - "Technical debt" is an overloaded and messy term. Kellan Elliott-McCrea attempts to clear up some of the confusion and fuzzy definitions.
