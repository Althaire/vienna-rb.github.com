### 14/8 Picks!!

In a little series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, funsies... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the seventeenth edition:

##### [Andy][1]:
  - [Hyperloop][2] - Short of figuring out real teleportation, which would of course be awesome (someone please do this), the only option for super fast travel is to build a tube 
over or under the ground. Read why it's so tricky and how they want to solve this.
  - [Maestro][3] - Container orchestration for Docker environments.
  - [Shell script ahoy][4] - What I learned from other's shell scripts.
  
##### [Floor][9]:
  - [Complicated Mechanisms Explained][10] - Complicated Mechanisms Explained in simple animations. I think this is just great.
  - [Codepen][11] - I really love Codepen's team picks of great CSS stuff on their homepage!
  - [Green slate][12] - Now you too can drink the "we only hire opensource contributors" kool-aid ;)
