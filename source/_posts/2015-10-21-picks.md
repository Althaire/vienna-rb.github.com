### 10/21 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-twenty-ninth edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [Rails Remote Conf][2] - Because remote confs are a thing now. 
- [Esoteric programming languages][3] - A fun little list

##### [Floor][9]:
- [hiring diversely][10] - The RubyRogues discuss hiring diversely with Sarah Mei.
- [Low Line][11] - There is an alternative to New York's famous High Line, the in-development Low Line. The underground park is found on the lower east side of Manhattan. And it just looks crazy beautiful.

##### [Markus][13]:
- [Debugging a Memory Leak on Heroku][14] - Richard Schneems shows how to debug memory leaks in your Rails app. Obviously, this also works for Rails apps not hosted on Heroku ;)
- [Storing Data with Redis][15] - Mike Perham on the bad habit of stuffing all your data into one Redis database.
- [Building Learning into our Process with Prototypes][16] - Kyle Fiedler on the importance of prototypes, especially when they fail.
