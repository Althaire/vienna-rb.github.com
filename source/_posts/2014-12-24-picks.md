### 12/24 Picks!

Merry Christmas everybody! In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the eighty-sixth edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
  - [Ferry][2] - a command-line tool for data migrations and manipulation by the students of Carnegie Mellon
  - [Starburst][3] - In-app announcements to users in your Rails app

##### [Ben][9]:
  - [Bad, bad, bad][10] - Bad code isn’t Technical Debt, it’s an unhedged Call Option
  - [Papers, please][11] - 10 Technical Papers Every Programmer Should Read (At Least Twice)


##### [Floor][17]:
  - [active_emoji][18] - [Erik][19] created a collection of emoji aliases for core Ruby methods. Got to love this.
  - [Evil Icons][20] - ... a simple and clean SVG icon pack with the code to support Rails, Sinatra and Node.js.
  - [tic-tac-toe][21] - play tic-tac-toe in your Terminal. Because you can.
