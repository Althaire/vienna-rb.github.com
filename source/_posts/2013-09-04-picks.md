### 4/9 Picks!!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the twentieth edition:

##### [Andy][1]:
  - [Unit Testing for the Non-TDDer][2] - Nice post by Bryan Powell on how he as a self-proclaimed non-tester was indeed testing, and started testing much earlier than he thought.
  - [brave clojure][3] - Clojure for the Brave and True. Yep.  
  - [mutation testing][4] - Markus Schirp's slides of his mutation testing talk (as seen at eurucamp and RedFrogConf).
  
##### [Floor][5]:
  - [bootstrap-wysihtml5][6] - Simple, beautiful wysiwyg editors.
  - [DevFest Vienna][7] - The program for DevFest Vienna is up, go register (especially for the hackathon - vienna.rb represent!)
  - [Confident Ruby][8] - Avdi's lastest brain child (Confident Ruby), is finished. Get your (e)copy!
