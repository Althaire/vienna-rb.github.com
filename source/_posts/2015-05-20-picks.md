### 05/20 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-seventh edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [Awesome Print][2] - Pretty print your Ruby objects with style
- [The Secret Life of your Database, part 1: Migrations][3] - a neat little article that take a look at database migrations. Bonus: the `rake db:migrate:status` command, which I had never used before <3
- [everyenv][4] - rbenv, but for ANYTHING

##### [Aaron][5]:
- [Why Everyone Hates Go][6] - An interesting take on why golang has so many haters. Angular could also fall into this reasoning.
- [Speakers Chosen For Full Stack Fest][7] - This conference looks like a must see. Amazing lineup.
- [Talks from Baruco 2013][8] - Since we're talking about Baruco (Full Stack Fest), here are the talks from 2013. It was, and still probably is, the best conference I have ever been to. It's super hard to pick a best, I think I'll pick them individually in the next editions of our picks!


##### [Floor][9]:
- [ReadRemaining.js][11] - Tell your readers how long they'll need to get through all of your gibberish, with this clever jQuery plugin.
- [ROSSConf Berlin][12] - Because who needs sleep, when there's conferences to organize?
