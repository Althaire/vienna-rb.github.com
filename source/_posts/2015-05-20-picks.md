##### [Laura][1]:
- [Awesome Print][2] - Pretty print your Ruby objects with style
- [The Secret Life of your Database, part 1: Migrations][3] - a neat little article that take a look at database migrations. Bonus: the `rake db:migrate:status` command, which I had never used before <3
- [everyenv][4] - rbenv, but for ANYTHING

##### [Aaron][5]:
- [][6] -
- [][7] -
- [][8] -


##### [Floor][9]:
