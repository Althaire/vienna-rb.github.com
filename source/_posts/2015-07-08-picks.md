### 07/08 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.

##### [Floor][9]:
- [Checkbox Trickery][10] - Checkboxes are purty. Combine them with the right CSS and you can pull off some really neat one-pagers.
- [PomodoroTimer][11] - a teensy pomodoro time-tracker in plain HTML5.
- [Gem 2015][12] - Building a Ruby gem in 2015, some pointers.
- [The lion is hawt][13] - a very cute thing in the internet.
