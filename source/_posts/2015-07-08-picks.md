### 07/08 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-fourteenth edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [The role of a senior developer][2] - a must read! Great post about roles in dev teams.
- [A look at Rails 5][3] - a quick rundown of the features presented by DHH at RailsConf
- [Passionate Voices: Katrina Owen][4] - Very interesting interview with Katrina Owen about passion, exercism, and her new project Skillflake.

##### [Aaron][5]:
- [Nothing is Something - Sandi Metz RailsConf 2015][6] - Really great talk about the Null Object Pattern and inheritance vs. Dependency Injection in Ruby.
- [POODR][7] - Sandi's book Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby. I will start reading mine today ;).


##### [Floor][9]:
- [Checkbox Trickery][10] - Checkboxes are purty. Combine them with the right CSS and you can pull off some really neat one-pagers.
- [PomodoroTimer][11] - a teensy pomodoro time-tracker in plain HTML5.
- [Gem 2015][12] - Building a Ruby gem in 2015, some pointers.
- [The lion is hawt][13] - a very cute thing in the internet.
