### 12/09 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-thirty-sixth edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [The life-changing magic of tidying up][2] - .. with web components
- [So you want to learn how to code][3] - [Isis Anchalee][4], the person behind the #ILookLikeAnEngineer hashtag, put together a great article with a huge list of resources for people looking to learn how to code, from web development to algorithms. 

##### [Markus][9]:
- [To the Moon: Parallels Between Space Missions and Developing Software][10] - Russ Olsen (of [Eloquent Ruby][13] and [Design Patterns in Ruby][14] fame) presented the keynote at GOTO Berlin 2015. InfoQ interviewed him about it.
- [7 common database design errors][11] - Demonstrated using real-life examples.
- [The TTY demystified][12] - Did you know that the fancy terminal you're using for your command line can trace its lineage back to a stock ticker device first released in 1869? And it's still emulating a video terminal from the 1970s?
