### 11/25 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-thirty-fourth edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [gitnonymous][2] - Contribute pseudonymously to Git repositories over Tor
- [Effective TDD with Ruby: vim setup][3] - Another instalment of Luca Guidi's series about TDD – this time with tips on building your own vim setup
- [Kumquat][4] - Render RMarkdown files inside Rails

##### [Floor][9]:
- [React on Rails][10] - React on Rails integrates Facebook's React front-end framework with Rails. And it's interesting stuff.
- [emoji support with MySQL & Rails][11] -  If you’re a MySQL user with a charset of utf8, you’ve probably noticed your database isn’t as excited about native emoji as your users are. There's a one-liner to change that though.
- [My life right now][12] - We will meet again.

##### [Markus][13]:
- [Brick laying and bug reports][14] - Thomas Cannon explains how to improve your bug fixing process.
- [There is No Now][15] - We humans might have a concept of "now", but there is no such thing when it comes to distributed systems.
- [Do You Know What a Good Environment Looks Like, Though?][16]
