### 9/7 Picks!!

In a little series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, funsies... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the twelfth edition:

##### [Andy][1]:
  - [Foundations of Computer Science][2] - Although the book has been taken out of print by W. H. Freeman, you are welcome to read it online. And I suggest you do. 
  - [The Elements of Style in Ruby #2][3] - Second in its series, topic being the following rule from the Ruby Style Guide: Favor the use of sprintf and its alias format over the fairly cryptic String#% method.
  - [ALL teh bots][4] - Do you know how to create a bot in Ruby? Now you do!

##### [Tony][5]:
  - [Gems that need help with Rails 4][6] - A Gist started by Steve Klabnik
  - [Bogus][7] - a library that aims to reduce the risks associated with isolated unit testing.
  - [Drain the oceans!][8] - ... and let the Netherlands rule?

##### [Floor][9]:
  - [console.image][10] - The one thing Chrome Dev Tools didn't need. The day has come when you have the ability to put images in the console.
  - [Programming Trends][11] - Programming trends on StackOverflow.
  - [Interview with Matz][12] - The future of computing, the future of computer programmers - an interview with Yukihiro Matsumoto.
