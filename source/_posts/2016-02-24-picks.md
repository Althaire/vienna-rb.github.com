### 02/24 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-forty-third edition:

##### [Ram√≥n][5]:
- [Youtube: The Game Boy, a hardware autopsy - Part 1: the CPU][6] - The first in a series of videos explaining how the original Game Boy works.
- [Gem: Bourbon, Neat, and Bitters][7] - A modular, SASS-based alternative to Bootstrap.
- [accounting.js][8] - A lightweight JavaScript framework for formatting currency values.

##### [Markus][9]:
- [Understand TDD by asking one simple question][10] - Pat Maddox manages to boil down the basics of TDD into a simple question.
- [Simple 8-bit Assembler Simulator][11] - A complete simulation of a simple 8-bit assembler written in JavaScript, including visualizations of the CPU and memory. Great for exploring how a program actually works on a near-machine level.
- [Towards an understanding of technical debt][12] - "Technical debt" is an overloaded and messy term. Kellan Elliott-McCrea attempts to clear up some of the confusion and fuzzy definitions.

##### [Gerald](http://twitter.com/viennahtml):
- [Using Markdown with the kramdown Library and Tools](http://talks.gettalong.org/2016-02-vienna-html) -  by Thomas Leitner (author of kramdown from - surprise, surprise - Vienna); slides (in HTML)
- [Vienna Opens World's 1st Dr. Jekyll Walk-in Clinic](https://github.com/viennahtml/members/issues/13) - any question or trouble with static sites? Ask Dr. Jekyll and get free advice and in-person answers at the next meetup.
- [Static Blogging Tool Face-Off: Middleman vs Jekyll](http://www.sitepoint.com/static-blogging-g-face-middleman-vs-jekyll) - by David Turnbull published on SitePoint (Nov/2015)
- [GitLab Pages](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-examples/pages-middleman) - powered by - surprise, surprise - Middleman ;-)
