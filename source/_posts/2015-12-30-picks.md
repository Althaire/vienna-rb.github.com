### 12/30 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-thirty-ninth edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [How to fix a bug in an Open Source Project][2] - this article isn't so much about making your first pull request (though it lists a couple of important tips) but rather, about the process of fixing bugs for a codebase you're unfamiliar with.
- [Ruby 2.3.0][3] - Ruby 2.3.0 was released on Christmas day. 
- [RailsConf CFP][4] - The RailsConf CFP is still open until January 15th. 

##### [Markus][13]:
- [Fallout 4 Service Discovery and Relay][14] - You might not care about Fallout 4, but Kyle Kelley's post on how he figured out how the companion iOS/Android app finds and communicates with the game is a very interesting read in any case.
- [25,000+ Req/s for Rack JSON API with MRuby][15] - [mruby][mruby] doesn't get nearly as much coverage as Ruby does, but as Luca Guidi shows, mruby doesn't have to hide in the shadow of its older sibling, especially when it comes to performance.
- [The 100:10:1 method: my approach to open source][16] - [@fogus][fogus] explains his decision making process for what to release as open source.
