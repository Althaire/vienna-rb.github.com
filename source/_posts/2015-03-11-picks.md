### 03/11 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the ninety-seventh edition:

##### [Laura][1]:

##### [Aaron][5]:
- [Includes vs Joins in Rails: When and where? | ][6] - A post from Tom Dallimore about the difference between ActiveRecord `joins` and `includes` methods. The differences surprised me.
- [Foodhack Vienna][7] - I am organizing a hackathon on March 28th and 29th in Vienna to build software to help reduce food waste. We currently throw away 20% of our food... yikes.
- [The Case for Case][8] - If you are using a lot of `if` and `elsif`'s in your code, Daniel Clark shows you some of the practical and more obscure ways to start implementing `case` statements instead.
