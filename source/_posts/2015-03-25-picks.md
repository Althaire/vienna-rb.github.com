### 03/25 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the ninety-ninth edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [Eurucamp CFP][2] - The Eurucamp Call for Proposals is now open!
- [Try SQL][3] - There's a new SQL course in town (aka on CodeSchool)

##### [Aaron][5]:
- [Tired of conditionals? State pattern could help][6] - If you missed [Markus Prinz's](https://twitter.com/nuclearsquid) talk about state machines, or you want to know more, here's a great article for you.
- [Heroku upgrade to Cedar-14][7] - Cedar-10 reaches its end of life on November 4th 2015. Upgrade ASAP so you don't get screwed at the last minute.


##### [Floor][9]:
- [the changelog][10] - A beginnerâ€™s guide to creating a README
- [ROSS Conf Vienna][11] - who doesn't want to pair with Michal Papis, Katrina Owen or Arne Brasseur?
- [Open Source Camp][12] - Open Source Camp is an initiative with selected talents, experts, early stage start-ups and project teams who meet for an intensive two-day workshop and join forces as a community. Plus: you could end up getting funding via the netidee call.
