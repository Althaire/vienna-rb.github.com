### 09/09 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-twenty-third edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [RubyMotion 4.0][2] - The new RubyMotion is out, complete with a FREE Starter edition. <3
- [Bootstrap 4 alpha][3] - It's here.
- [Stripe Open Source Retreat 2016][4] - You can apply until September 30th for this!


##### [Aaron][5]:
- [Monocle Source][6] - If you want to see a pretty nice way to set up a modular Sinatra app, check out the source code for Monocle. I use this style in all of my Sinatra services.
- [Starcraft HTML5][7] - An implementation of Starcraft written as an HTML5 app. Pretty sweet dude.
- [Black Screen][8] - A terminal emulator written in javascript. The feature set is pretty nice and it's beautiful! But alas, there are still too many bugs for me to drop zsh.


##### [Floor][9]:
- [Refugee Hackathon][10] - Aaron set up a mailing list for Refugee Hackathon (where we built software solutions for refugees) at the most recent vienna.rb meetup.
- [Twitter Bot][11] - Create a simple Twitter Bot with Ruby.
- [October meetup][12] - Technically there's no date yet, but it will be awesome as ever.
