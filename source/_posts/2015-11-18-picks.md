### 11/18 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-thirty-third edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [Understanding self in Ruby][2] - A nice little Ruby `self` cheat sheet ;)
- [Why is it so hard to find a Front-End developer][3] - I couldn't agree more: "Front end development, like any specialized trade or spectator sport, is a lot harder than it looks."
- [Understanding branches in Git][4] - From a series about understanding Git on the thoughtram blog.

##### [Floor][9]:
- [An inside look with Laura Frank][10] - Laura shares on the Codeship blog why she feels a responsibility to speak about tech, why sheâ€™s a huge advocate for Docker, and why technologists have an obligation to society.
- [new to the team][11] - The Ruby Rogues discuss onboarding new team members.  
- [DevFest 2015][12] - No plans for this weekend yet? Good. You can still register for the free and fun DevFest, with a remarkably interesting line-up this year.

##### [Markus][13]:
- [What can you put in a refrigerator?][14] - Seems like an easy question, doesn't it?
- [Suggesting a corrected column name/spelling in the event of a column misspelling][15] - When you mistype a column name in `psql`, PostgreSQL 9.6 will be able to suggest the correct name for you.
- [Why is Swift's String API So Hard?][16] - You might think of strings in programming languages as a fairly simple thing, but they really aren't. Mike Ash describes why the Swift String API is the way it is, which can also teach you a lot about how other languages approach the same topic.

##### [Benjamin][17]
- [Ruby 3 will be 3 times faster][18] - Matz' goal with Ruby 3 is to be 3 times faster than Ruby 2, and the way to reach that goal is corporate sponsorship, says Appfolio and hires/sponsors a full-time engineer to work with the Ruby core team on the performance of Ruby.
