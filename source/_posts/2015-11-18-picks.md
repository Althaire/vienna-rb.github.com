### 11/18 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.

##### [Aaron][5]:

##### [Floor][9]:
- [An inside look with Laura Frank][10] - Laura shares on the Codeship blog why she feels a responsibility to speak about tech, why sheâ€™s a huge advocate for Docker, and why technologists have an obligation to society. 
- [new to the team][11] - The Ruby Rogues discuss onboarding new team members.  
- [DevFest 2015][12] - No plans for this weekend yet? Good. You can still register for the free and fun DevFest, with a remarkably interesting line-up this year.
